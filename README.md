### Is programming knowledge necessary for success in the cybersecurity domain?
Well, it depends! 
Programming knowledge is essential in cybersecurity. It helps understand how software works, identify vulnerabilities, write automation scripts, conduct code reviews, and analyse malware. 

While not mandatory for every role, it's crucial for advanced areas like application security, reverse engineering, and secure software development. I'm also partially into the pentest job.

My suggestion is to learn the very basics of programming, like Python, and understand how to read and execute code.

### It is necessary to be good at communication and soft skills; if so, why?
Aboslutely yes. Communication and soft skills are essential in cybersecurity. 
Security professionals must explain technical risks to non-technical stakeholders, collaborate with teams, and influence decision-making. 
Soft skills also help effectively manage security policies, incident response, and training.

> [!TIP]
> Moreover, when you grow up the ladder, you will see why people with good soft skills and writing skills are preferred in senior roles. That means you should be very good at your core skills!

### What should I do to move from the Pentest role to the Security Architecture role?
To transition from a Pentesting role to a Security Architecture role:

- Develop a deep understanding of security design principles (e.g., defense-in-depth, secure software lifecycle).
- Gain experience in threat modeling and secure software architecture.
- Broaden your knowledge of compliance, risk management, and security frameworks (e.g., NIST, ISO).
- Learn to design scalable security solutions and align them with business goals.
- Improve communication skills for engaging with various stakeholders and leadership.

### I have 90 days notice period. Recruiters don't entertain after hearing this. What do you think I should do to get an interview call?
